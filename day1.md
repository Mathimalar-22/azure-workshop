cloud computing gives on demand access to computing services over the internet offering scalablity and cost effectiveness...these are divided into Iaas,Paas,Saas.
IAAS-provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
Paas-offers a platform for developers to build and deploy applications without managing infrastructure.
Saas-delivers software applications via the internet on a subscription basis.

in iaas the users should take care if data and access,applications,runtime,os,and virtual machine whole the csp would take csre of the mananaging,storing data...in the case of Paas the data and acess,applications are to be taken care of the user,while the rest by csp...coming to Saas only the data and access is taken care by user while the others by csp.


on premises-it includes computing  resources and softwares physically located within companies own facilities, requiring the organization to manage, maintain, and secure the infrastructure and applications directly.
AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Azure (Microsoft Azure) are cloud service providers that offer a variety of cloud computing solutions.Both AWS and Azure also offer options for hybrid cloud environments, allowing companies to integrate on-premises resources with cloud solutions. This combination enables organizations to leverage the benefits of both cloud computing and local infrastructure.

physical infrastructure-refers to the tangible hardware and facilities necessary to support IT operations, such as servers, data centers, and networking equipment. It provides the foundational resources for storing and processing data, running applications, and enabling connectivity within an organization.

management infrastrcutre-on the other hand, encompasses the tools, processes, and systems used to monitor, maintain, and optimize the physical infrastructure. This includes software for resource allocation, performance monitoring, security management, and ensuring compliance with operational standards, enabling efficient and effective management of IT resources.

sovereign regions-data stored and processed in these regions must ahdere to local laws regarding privacy ,security and data residency.few examples are European Union,Australia,China,India and US.
