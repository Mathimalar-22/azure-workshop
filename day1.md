# Cloud Computing Overview

Cloud computing gives on-demand access to computing services over the internet, offering scalability and cost-effectiveness. These services are divided into three primary categories:

## Service Models

### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- **IaaS** provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- Users manage:
  - Data and access
  - Applications
  - Runtime
  - OS
  - Virtual machines
- The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) manages storage, networking, and physical servers.

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- **PaaS** offers a platform for developers to build and deploy applications without managing underlying infrastructure.
- Users manage:
  - Data and access
  - Applications
- The CSP handles runtime, OS, servers, storage, and networking.

### SaaS (Software as a Service)
- **SaaS** delivers software applications via the internet on a subscription basis.
- Users are responsible only for managing their data and access.
- The CSP manages everything else, including applications, runtime, OS, servers, and networking.

## On-Premises Infrastructure

- **On-premises** refers to computing resources and software physically located within a companyâ€™s own facilities.
- The organization is responsible for:
  - Managing
  - Maintaining
  - Securing the infrastructure and applications directly

---

## Cloud Service Providers

### AWS and Azure
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and **Microsoft Azure** are two leading cloud service providers offering a variety of cloud computing solutions.
- Both AWS and Azure provide options for **hybrid cloud environments**, enabling companies to integrate on-premises resources with cloud solutions. This allows organizations to benefit from both cloud computing and local infrastructure.

## Infrastructure Types

### Physical Infrastructure
- Refers to the **tangible hardware** and facilities necessary to support IT operations, such as:
  - Servers
  - Data centers
  - Networking equipment
- It provides the foundational resources for storing and processing data, running applications, and enabling connectivity within an organization.

### Management Infrastructure
- **Management infrastructure** includes the tools, processes, and systems used to monitor, maintain, and optimize the physical infrastructure.
- This includes:
  - Resource allocation software
  - Performance monitoring
  - Security management
  - Compliance with operational standards

---

## Sovereign Regions
- Data stored and processed in **sovereign regions** must adhere to local laws regarding privacy, security, and data residency.
- Examples of sovereign regions include:
  - European Union
  - Australia
  - China
  - India
  - United States.
